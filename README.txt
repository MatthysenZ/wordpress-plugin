[Tatum](https://tatum.io/) is the easiest and fastest free plugin to work with NFTs without any blockchain development experience.

== Description ==

With the Tatum plugin, you can easily **create a wallet, deploy, mint, and sell NFTs!**
The Tatum plugin depends on the Woocommerce plugin and makes it possible to mint NFT tokens with **ETH, CELO, and Binance Smart Chain!**

With the Tatum plugin, you can:

*   Sell NFTs
*   Generate wallets
*   Mint NFTs

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the Tatum plugin and get it working.

1. Create an account in the [Tatum Dashboard](https://dashboard.tatum.io/login) and obtain an API key.
2. Add the Tatum API key to the Tatum plugin. This step will also generate a wallet.
3. Fund your address with crypto. Then fill in the Contract name and symbol and click Save. This step will deploy your NFT smart contract to the blockchain.
4. Refresh your page multiple times after the NFT smart contract has been deployed. Now you are ready to mint your NFT tokens!
5. Select your API key in the General settings section of the Tatum plugin. For the sake of simplicity, we will also enable automatic product minting.
6. Now, when we create a product, the Tatum plugin will mint an NFT token.
7. When a customer adds a product to the cart and proceeds to checkout, they will be asked to enter an address where NFT tokens will be sent.
8. After the order has been paid and is being processed, the NFT tokens will be transferred to the address entered.

= Can customers sell their NFT? =

No. The plugin could be only used to sell the NFT created by Admin to the customers.

= How does it work when Automatic Minting is disabled? =

When Automatic minting is disabled, you need to specify the URL and the token id for every NFT token you are minting.
If you have enabled Automatic minting, then the token id will be incremented from zero, adding one for each minted NFT and the URL will be the same for all NFTs.
